\section{Introduction}

The biggest e-commerce sites in Bangladesh e.g., Daraz, Rokomari, Pickaboo, Evaly etc. all focuses their business either as all-in-one solution for all products or some generic popular streams like books or electronics. But one side we see less of is e-commerce sites focusing on clothing. Through this project our web application will try to fill this void. Our web application will be a one stop solution for all the clothing and apparel needs for people from all spere of life. This web application will contain all product information with picture for the customers to judge. They can add product to the cart/Wishlist to order later or can order a product immediately. There will a merchant side of the application from where merchants can add products to the site and see how a particular product is performing. In Bangladesh almost every fashion brand is Dhaka or urban centric. With our web app they can reach people throughout the country. A online e-commerce site can be becon to a revolutionary change on how people shops clothes.

\end{enumerate}

\end{itemize}




\section{Value Proposition}

\subsection{Eliminates Inventory Cost}
One of the biggest drawbacks of running an offline retail business is it needs a lot of inventory cost. But in e-commerce the merchant can deliver their product from their warehouse. Thus, inventory cost eliminates. 

\subsection{Lower Costs}
In e-commerce the merchant can sell the product with less employee and less place. Which obviously reduce cost maximize the profit and the gets enough room to give offer to their customers so that they will buy more. 

\subsection{Flexibility}
One customer can buy goods from anywhere they want. The customers no need to go out and find some times for shopping. They can order and get delivery to their home.

\begin{itemize}
\item HTML
\item JavaScript
\item MySQL
\item PHP
\item Web server
\item  Different APIs
\end{itemize}


\section{Challenge}
One of the biggest challenges for this idea to work is the consumer behavior of the people. People are a bit skeptical in buying clothes from online sites. So, ensuring top notch customer services is a must. The web application needs to be user friendly so that people of ages and from every aspect of life can navigate their way through to find new items to buy. There will be a huge number of products and it will be a challenge to show appropriate products to the customers. Then as an e-commerce site it will be a challenge to give financial security to customers. Finally, sending the ordered products to the doorsteps of the people will also be a huge undertake.
